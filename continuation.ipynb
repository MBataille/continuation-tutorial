    "## Main idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a dynamical system described by the following (system of coupled) ODE(s),\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dfrac{d}{dt} \\bm{u} = \\bm{F}(\\bm{u}, \\eta),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\bm{u}$ is the state vector and $\\eta$ the control parameter. In the case of a PDE or integro-differential equation, it can be discretized in space and approximated by a system of ODEs,\n",
    "corresponding to the above equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of numerical continuation, is to obtain both stable and unstable equilibria of the dynamical system as the parameters are varied (bifurcation diagram). In what follows, we will restrict the analysis to only steady states or fixed point, for simplicity. Nevertheless, the method can be extended to find limit cycles as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the equilibria\n",
    "\n",
    "Steady states do not evolve in time, therefore they satisfy the following (system of nonlinear) equation(s),\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bm{F}(\\bm{u}, \\eta) = 0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above equation can be solved through various methods, the preferred one is Newton-Raphson's for its fast (quadratic) convergence and simplicity. Consider an initial guess $\\bm{u}_0$ close enough to the 'true' solution, succesive points will be determined through the following Eqs.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bm{J}(\\bm{u}_i, \\eta) \\Delta \\bm{u}_{i+1} = -\\bm{F}(\\bm{u}_i, \\eta) \\\\\n",
    "\\bm{u}_{i+1} = \\bm{u}_i + \\Delta \\bm{u}_{i+1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\bm{J}$ is the Jacobian of $\\bm{F}$. Since the Jacobian is computed at each iteration, it can be used to find the stability and detect bifurcation points!\n",
    "\n",
    "We now know how to find a solution for a fixed parameter value, let's see how it can be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Varying the parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole point of the continuation is to obtain the bifurcation diagram, i.e. the solution as the parameter is varied. There are several strategies, the simplest and most frequent are the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Natural parameter continuation\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic strategy would be to find the solution $\\bm{u}_0$ for $\\eta = \\eta_0$, then take a small step $\\Delta \\eta$, and find the solution $\\bm{u}_1$ for $\\eta = \\eta_0 + \\Delta \\eta$\n",
    "using the previous solution as initial guess. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate the method with a simple example, consider the imperfect pitchfork bifurcation with $\\varepsilon = 1$.\n",
